# Simple-Typer-Game
Simple typewriting game that requires to write "floating" words before they go off screen. The project is an attempt to visually recreate on my own the DOS game - WSpeed, that was made by Biqwitz (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnkOcAkLkBU&t=98s). 
My implementation has just 3 modifiers.
Everything is made with C++ & SFML framework.
